> This blog post holds my individual views only. They are not associated with my work at The Oater. The Oater is a company with more than one opinion. We may pursue corporate goals that are not necessarily congruent with the individual goals of certain stakeholders.

On July Xrd, 2025, The Oater received official approval for its most long standing patent application at the [DPMA](https://www.dpma.de/) from January 23rd, 2023.
This is the kind of milestone that feels big - until you realize it took over **30 months** from the submission to acceptance.
Multiple rounds of review, examiner reports, claim adjustment, and substantial costs were involved.
So why go through it?
Why should startups — resource-constrained by design — spend time and capital on intellectual property?
And could that money have been used more effectively elsewhere?
We will investigate on that issue in this short blog entry.

# Context: Teece on innovation and appropriability

To set the stage: **David J. Teece’s 1986** work, *Profiting from Technological Innovation*, offers a foundational insight on innovator/imitator interaction and how and when up- and downstream suppliers may also benefit.
Despite being written almost 40 years ago, the concepts remain shockingly accurate and can even be applied to today's AI revolution.

Teece acknowledges that innovators rarely succeed through invention alone.
In fact, innovators might even loose their market advantage, when the innnovation is generated without the possession of 
- **A** the required cospecialized assets, such as distribution or manufacturing capabilities
- **B** presence of tight appropriability regimes, when the innovator does possess an iron clad patent or copyright protection and  
- **C** a product readiness that ensures a moderate design float from innovation to market readiness.  

Teece also claims that process patents are usually weaker in their protection power as small changes to the upstream process (and thus e. g. to a molecule) usually bypass existing protections while a similar product with innoticable differences may be derived (e. g. generika).

# Reviewing The Oater’s innovation, appropriability regime, and market power

The Oater patentet its batch-container.
The container holds integrated production and cleaning capabilities, including a mixing rod, cleaning nozzles and container inlets that may be rotated, opening during filling and closing during fermenation.  
So let's assess The Oater's market position in Teece's three dimensions.
- **A** The Oater does not hold the cospecialized assets to make use of their product innovation.
The manufacturing capabbilities are held by suppliers. The machine is then sold on the market, possibly giving access to the innovation to anyone who buys a machine.  
- **B** The Oater holds a patent with a rather weak approbability regime, as other production capabilities or product variants are (both in terms of system design and process management) are not only conceivable, but are already being used by the industry. Nevertheless, The Oater's patent applies to the production in a small space with only one batch (fed-batch process), which could hinder on-the-shelf competition.  
- **C** Lastly, the market readiness of The Oater Barista oat drink machine is certainly given, as The Oater is selling the product since spring 2024. This is good news for The Oater.  

We conlcude that only one of the three prerequisits for an innovator to benefit from its innovation are present.

Moreover, it is evident that The Oater's financial limits significantly reduce the speed at which an innovation yields a market/revenue success.
Teece notes that this “head start” phase is a one-time event for the innovator.
Once it has passed, the market advantages shift to asset holders and imitators.
Due to generally speaking, predominantly weak approvability regimes, imitators tend to replicate innovation easily and may exploit the set up on a stronger chain of upstream and downstream products and suppliers and consequently tend to offer comparable products at a better price point after the head start phase.

The Oater has been selling the product under patent protection since the beginning of 2023.
The patent protection is retroactive but was not issued until August 2025.
Hence, the head start phase has already begun, and is most likely endangered through the patent publication by giving imitators potential access to the technology that they would not have been aware about or would have had to get access to the innovation by buying/renting the innovation.
The latter may be prevented by strong protection claims in leasing contracts.  

Summing up, only one of the three prerequisits for innovation benefit are present, the head-start phase was not influenced by the patent process and, lastly, immitators might even benefit from the patent publication. That is a bitter pill to swallow. On the other hand the patent recognizes The Oater's right to use its technology even if imitators copy it and apply for a patent, themselves. From Teece's point of view, patenting would not have had any influence on whether The Oater could convert its innovation into an economic advantage or not.
Let's now shift gears and focus on the patent from an investors point of view.

# A different viewpoint: IP as a signaling device for investors

For institutional investors and VCs, patents matter not primarily for enforcement (which rarely occurs at the startup stage) but because of their signaling effect. Patens proof the degree of innovation that is most likely claimed in any pitch deck. The also serve as a third-party validation, where knowledgable examiners approve the work outside of the two party startup - investor interaction. A Patent therefore is a viable asset of a company and worth money.

In essence, **IP is third-party proof-of-work**.
In ecosystems where due diligence is fast and asymmetric, patents lend credibility through an unbiased examiner.
A patent-backed company is more likely to protect its technological edge and offer **differentiated customer value**.

## The time to file was yesterday. Yesterdy four years ago.

The Oater’s path—from initial submission through [DPMA](https://www.dpma.de/) and [EPO](https://www.epo.org/en) review cycles, to final approval—demonstrates the slow grind of patent offices.
Founders who postpone IP until after traction miscalculate lead times.
To have an impact on evaulation during Series A fundraising or exit negotiations, filing must begin 24–30 months in advance.
Add another 6–12 months for invention maturity and drafting, and the full cycle reaches **3–4 years**.
As this process is mostly dependent on the lead time of authorities, there is no real way to accelerate the process for a company. This clashes with most startups' 12-month planning horizons.

## IP is expensive, slow, and mostly optional

Most patents are never enforced, often denied or narrowed and, even when granted, the do not generate revenue!
Yet, process cost is unavoidable.
Plan with a budget of around 50,000 EUR per full cycle, leaving out recurring costs for upholding the patent in various states.
Costs may include drafting, legal opinions, translations (three languages are compulsory for patents filed at the EPO), research fees as well as the continuous support of a law firm that helps to navigate the delicate process of patent application.

So what should startups do? With my limited knowledge from filing two patents at DPMA and the EPO for The Oater, I suggest to:
- **Think strategically** – file only when core IP is your single source of revenue.
- **Start early** – otherwise IP might not considered in the company's evaluation in a fundraising round.
- **Budget realistically** – account at least around 50,000 EUR for a full cycle with recurring costs after patent approval depending on the number of countries in which the innovator wishes to maintain its patent protection.
- **Know your audience** – patents aren’t for customers, and they aren't for you either. They’re for partners, acquirers, and VCs.

The Oater is proud of its patent! But prouder still that The Oater treated IP as part of our **long-term value architecture**, putting in the effort three years ago, and now finally seeing the fruits.
