{: .highlight }
This recipe shines when time is available in abundance. Start only, when enough time for first and second rise can be given.

# Flour as base
The recipe is based on $$m = 1000\,\text{g}$$ of bread flour (Type 550 or US bread flour, high gluten, high protein).

> Definition: Poolish
>
> Poolish is a hydrated pre-ferment of Polish origin, introduced into French baking in the 19th century. The name derives from the word “Polish” (via French spelling). It is made with equal parts flour and water (i.e., 100% hydration) and a small amount of yeast.
> Purpose: Poolish enhances aroma, flavor complexity, and dough extensibility while improving crumb structure and crust quality. It allows for long fermentation without sourness, making it ideal for baguettes and other lean breads.
> We use a recipe found online (link provided in the reference section) and add the poolish dough style.

# Total quantities
- water (20 °C): $$x_w = 0.70$$.  
- salt: $$x_s = 0.02$$.  
- yeast: $$x_y = 0.005$$.  

# Preparation

## Mixing (evening)

{: .warning }
Yeast and salt do not get along well. Never add both at the same time or mix together. Add flour and yeast, mix, then add salt. Or add flour and salt, mix, then add yeast. We leave out the salt for the first rise.

1. Add $$ 0.5 m $$ to a large bowl.  
2. Add $$ m_w $$.  
3. Add $$ m_y $$ (its easier to dissolve the yeast in a part of the water, then add water-yeast-mix to bowl).  
4. Mix with a fork or handle of a large spoon until it resembles a watery meal of goodness.
5. Cover and **let rest for 1 hour**.

## First rise (overnight)
Rest for **10-16 hours** in fridge (approx. 7 °C).  
Dough will double and show bubbles on the surface.

# Shaping (morning)
Add residual $$ 0.5 m $$.  
Add $$ x_s m $$ salt.  
Knead with dough hook for 10 min.  
Knead by hand (fold and pull).
Pull into a balloon and cover.

## Second rise (2-4 hours)
Let the balloon **rest for another 1-2 hours**.
Divide into 4–5 equal pieces using a dough scraper.  
Transfer to baking sheet (stone or cast iron pan or tray).  
Gently stretch each piece into baguette shape (30–35 cm).  
Let the baguette **rest for another 1 hours**.  
Preheat oven to **250 °C (480 °F)**.

# Baking
Add steam by placing a tray of boiling water on the bottom rack.  
Bake for **25 minutes**, or until crust is golden and crisp.  
Cool on a wire rack for 10–15 minutes before serving.
