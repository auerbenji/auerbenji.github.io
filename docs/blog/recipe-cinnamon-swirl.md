# Flour as base
{: .note }
The recipe is based on $$m = 1000\,\text{g}$$ flour and fractions for the additional components are provided.
A base of $$ 1000 \text{g} $$ of flour yields approximately **2 loafs** of braided dough, around 2.6 kg of total mass.
Use type 550 flour. High gluten high protein flour gives the dough the characteristic structure.

# Total quantities
For a base flour mass of $$m = 1000\,\text{g}$$, the following total ingredient quantities apply:
- water: $$ x_w = 0.50 $$
- salt: $$ x_s = 0.01 $$
- yeast: $$ x_y = 0.03 $$
- sugar: $$ x_s = 0.57 $$
- butter: $$ x_b = 0.52 $$
- cinnamon: $$ x_{ci} = 0.02 $$
- cardamom: $$ x_{ca} = 0.005 $$
- eggs: 3 pieces

# Preparation
Add $$ m $$ in a bow.  
Add $$ x_s m $$ salt.  
Mix. Form a flour well.

## Starting the yeast
Pour $$ 0.4 \cdot x_w m $$ water in a cup (20 C warm).  
Add $$ 0.01 \cdot x_s m $$ sugar.  
Add $$ x_y m $$ yeast.  
Mix until yeast and sugar is dissolved.  
Pour into a flour well, cover, and let rise for **20 minutes**.

## Cinnamon-butter filling
While the yeast activates, prepare the filling.  
Add $$ 0.75 \cdot x_bm $$ butter in a bowl.  
Add $$ 0.70 \cdot x_sm $$ sugar.  
Add $$ x_{ci}m $$ cinnamon.  
Add $$ x_{ca}m $$ cardamom.  
Blend with a mixer.

# Main dough
Take the main bowl (pre-dough in flour well) and
Add $$ 0.25 \cdot x_b m $$ butter.  
add $$ 0.29 \cdot x_s m $$ sugar.  
Add $$ 0.60 \cdot x_w m $$ water.  
Add 3 eggs.  
**Knead for 10 minutes**.

## Resting
1. Place dough in the oven at **50°C** for **1 hour**.  
2. Turn off oven and let rest for another **1 hour**.

## Shaping
1. Pour dough onto floured surface and dust with flour.  
2. Stretch into a rectangle (long side facing the baker).  
3. Spread with cinnamon-butter mixture.  
4. Roll up from the far edge toward the baker.  
5. Twist into a braid.  
6. Place into a **loaf pan**.

## Second rise
Preheat oven to 150 °C (300 F).  
Let swirl rise in the loaf pan for **20 minutes**.

# Baking
Bake for **40 minutes**.
