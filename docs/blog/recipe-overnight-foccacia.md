{: .highlight }
This recipe shines when time is available in abundance. Start only, when enough time for first and second rise can be given.

# Flour as base
The recipe is based on $$m = 1000\,\text{g}$$ of foccacia/pizza flour (type 405 or Nuvola type 0).

> Definition: Poolish
>
> Poolish is a hydrated pre-ferment of Polish origin, introduced into French baking in the 19th century. The name derives from the word “Polish” (via French spelling). It is made with equal parts flour and water (i.e., 100% hydration) and a small amount of yeast.
> Purpose: Poolish enhances aroma, flavor complexity, and dough extensibility while improving crumb structure and crust quality. It allows for long fermentation without sourness, making it ideal for baguettes and other lean breads.
> We use a recipe found online (link provided in the reference section) and add the poolish dough style.

# Total quantities
- water (20 °C): $$x_w = 0.65$$.  
- salt: $$x_s = 0.02$$.  
- yeast: $$x_y = 0.005$$.  
- oil: $$ x_o = 0.02 $$ (use high quality extra virgin olive oil. More oil is required for seasoning, have at least $$\frac{2}{5} m $$ of olive oil available).

# Preparation

## Mixing (evening)

{: .warning }
Yeast and salt do not get along well. Never add both at the same time or mix together. Add flour and yeast, mix, then add salt. Or add flour and salt, mix, then add yeast. We leave out the salt for the first rise.

1. Add $$ 0.5 m $$ to a large bowl.  
2. Add $$ m_w $$.  
3. Add $$ m_y $$ (its easier to dissolve the yeast in a part of the water, then add water-yeast-mix to bowl).  
4. Mix with a fork or handle of a large spoon until it resembles a watery meal of goodness.
5. Cover and **let rest for 1 hour**.

## First rise (overnight)
Rest for **10-16 hours** in fridge (approx. 7 °C).  
Dough will double and show bubbles on the surface.

# Shaping (morning)
Add residual $$ 0.5 m $$.  
Add $$ x_s m $$ salt.  
Add $$ x_o m $$ oil.  
Knead with dough hook for 10 min.  
Knead by hand (fold and pull).
Pull into a balloon and cover.

## Second rise (4-5 hours)
Let the balloon **rise for another 1-2 hours**.
Divide into 2 equal loafs using a dough scraper.  
Let the loaf **rise for another 1 hour**.  
Season loaf form with olive oil.  
Add loaf into loaf form.  
Stretch dough slightly towards the corners / edges of form.  
Press down with all 10 fingers into dough, starting from the center and working towards the edges.  
Let loaf **rise for another 1 hour**.  
Top with desired focaccia filling.  
Let loaf **rise for another 1 hour**.  
Preheat oven to **160 °C (320 °F)**.  

# Baking
Drizzle loaf with olive oil.  
Bake on the **middle rack for 20 minutes**.  
Increase heat to **250 °C (480 °F)**.  
Move to bottom of oven.  
Bake for another 5-15 minutes.  

# Cool off
After removing the foccacia from the oven, soak with a lot of olive oil.
After 10 minutes, rock the form, remove from loaf form sides and let cool on baking grille.
Consume warm.
If consumed next day, consider re-heating in oven for 10 minutes.
