# Projects

Hello friend, find my projects here.

My projects mostly concern optimization, hoping to give an insight in some of the work that I have been doing during my time as a researcher and as general manager and COO of The Oater.
Optimization problems from university are usually small, eagle-eyed readers may find the optimal solution just by looking, or, by inserting any real number between -2 and 2.
Optimization problem from research are usually terribly big, hard to solve and are meant to push the boundaries of what can be solved for.
The problems I present have real-world size and always an application/problem-driven motivation.
I present the code that I run. I use open source optimization software. Problems are written in [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) using various solvers.
Sometimes I compare [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) to other modeling languages/solvers such as [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/).
