Flexibility analysis (FA) assess a system's ability to adapt to changing operating conditions and has proved especially useful when comparing different design choices as FA provides a single, unified metric.
While mature theory and solution algorithms are readily available its inherent complexity in formulation as well as its computational burden hinders broad application extending beyond its origins in chemical engineering.
This work applies FA to a large-scale location-allocation problem for electric vehicle charging infrastructure planning, resulting in a multi-period mixed-integer linear programming optimization problem. The investigateg reformulations and shortcut-methods, substantially decreased computational complexity.
The system is then studied for its flexibility against limited travel distance and infrastructure investment for varying bounds of uncertainty.
We show that the original planning problem can be solved for the flexible solution gaining Pareto curves between robustness of the solution and the required additional investment without any necessity to solve the FA problem by exploiting the network problem structure.
